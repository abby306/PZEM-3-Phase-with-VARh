# PZEM-3-Phase-with-VARh
It is an Arduino Sketch based on ESP32 which utilizes both cores of the ESP32 and involves 3 Pzem-004t with CT modules for measuring the following values: voltages, currents, power (W), frequency, power factor, energy (KWh). I added a functionality to this to calculate Reactive Power (VAR) in real time and calculate and store Reactive Energy(VARh)
